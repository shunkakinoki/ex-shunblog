LOOK AT ME.

I GOT NOTHING.

AND I KNOW FOR MYSELF WHAT I WANT TO DO IN MY LIFE.

YET HERE I AM,

NOT ABLE TO CONTROL MYSELF.

IT IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.

HOW CAN I LIVE MY LIFE TO THE FULL EXTENT.

LIVE THE MOMENT.

I KNOW THAT I AM NOT DOING WHAT I SHOULD RIGHT NOW.

CONSISTENCY BRO.

CONSISTENCY.

GRIT.

GRIND.

PUT IT BACK TOGETHER FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I AM GOING TO DIE SOONER OR LATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

AS A MATTER OF FACT,

I MAY ALREADY BE DEAD.

LOL.
